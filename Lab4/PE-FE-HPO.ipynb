You are not adding anything new but are reshaping and curating the existing data to make the existing patterns more apparent. Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work better than they would on a simple raw encoding.\n",

If you bring your own algorithm, your algorithm emits metrics by itself. In that case, you would need to add a metric definition object to define the format of those metrics through regex, so that Amazon SageMaker knows how to extract those metrics from your CloudWatch logs."

    "In this exercise, you examined a few tasks in feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization. First, you saw how you can encode features that are otherwise inaccessible to the model (such as the categorical features). In these circumstances, simple techniques like one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding can go a long way. These techniques also allowed you to get more from the features you already had, such as with the latitude. The encoding was already good in that case; however, the pattern was difficult for the model to use. Presenting that variable in a way that makes the data available to the model is a key to the development of a high-performing model."
