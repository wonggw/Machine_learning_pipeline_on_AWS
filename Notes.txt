Collaborative filtering

Custom model (amazon BYOC)

F1-Score is a Harmonic Mean(HM) of Precision and Recall

https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/NVIDIA-CUDA-by-NVIDIA/B07KKWXKSX

R and R^2 value should be small. If difference is too large, overfitted.

Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
 (For imbalanced data)

recordIO-wrapped protobuf (make the training faster)
Put data into S3 bucket. During training, the model will extract the data out from S3 bucket.

Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique( Used to generate data. Usually in medicine, fraud transaction)

Feature engineering

If there are 2 features with high correlation. Remove that feature. Also, remove feature that is highly correlated to the predicted analysis.


ln = natural log (logarithm transformation)

min max scaling is for small standard deviation.

Ordinal data have rank. Order matters.
Norminal data does not have rank. Order does not matter.

TF-IDF (for NLP)

hyperparameters tuning - grid search ( not used in real life)
- random search
- bayesian search

MLLiB (spark machine learning lilbrary for distrbuted computing)

databricks

EC2 is the virtual server
ECR is Elastic Container Registry (store algo) 

ECS is  Elastic Container Service - Not part of machine learning
EMR is Elastic MapReduce (micro service) - Not part of machine learning

Heuristics
virus scanning programs also run on heuristics IDS/IPS

Box plot is for outliers

ITIL methodology

fastapi

both request endpoint call is in json

https://gist.github.com/zzenonn/07f289dc2889267b7ea944611ab02762

Production Variant

A/B Testing normally has equal weights (new model)
Canary has heavy Blue, light green 
Blue/Green is 100% green
Green = v2

model run in parallel (in sage maker can be on the same machine)

endpoint = rest api
helper code = wrapper for rest api easier
inference code  = ML algo

Savings Plans / Spot instances

Elastic inferencing, flexiable insertion and removal of GPU

Data pipelines uses crawlers

Cloudwatch
No you do not need to pay for metrics
Need to pay for logs (storage cost)

Cron job - Scheduled job (automated)
Concept drift -  The lowering of model performance over time
Usually apply to all context. But some is slower than others. Recommendation(Fast) Images (Slower)

recall - TP /(TP+FN) cost of FN is high (in credit card FN cost is high)
precision - TP/(TP+FP) cost of FP is high
