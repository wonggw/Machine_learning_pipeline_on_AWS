Collaborative filtering

Custom model (amazon BYOC)

F1-Score is a Harmonic Mean(HM) of Precision and Recall

https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/NVIDIA-CUDA-by-NVIDIA/B07KKWXKSX

R and R^2 value should be small. If difference is too large, overfitted.

Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
 (For imbalanced data)

recordIO-wrapped protobuf (make the training faster)
Put data into S3 bucket. During training, the model will extract the data out from S3 bucket.

Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique( Used to generate data. Usually in medicine, fraud transaction)

Feature engineering

If there are 2 features with high correlation. Remove that feature. Also, remove feature that is highly correlated to the predicted analysis.


ln = natural log (logarithm transformation)

min max scaling is for small standard deviation.

Ordinal data have rank. Order matters.
Norminal data does not have rank. Order does not matter.

TF-IDF (for NLP)

hyperparameters tuning - grid search ( not used in real life)
- random search
- bayesian search
